# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Usage

To use this project, move the `ERC721` folder to your desktop or other places

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```
npx hardhat run --network <network-name> scripts/deploy.ts
```
